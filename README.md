## My process

1- Doing the basic HTML
2- Thinking about the layout structure and how to get as close as possible using css.
3- Adding a few classes and elements according to the layout in my head.
4- Importing the font and creating color vars
5- Start working on the CSS itself

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

To use auto margins to center elements, easy and handy to do.
To use the position css property to adjust a div used only with a image background, since a simple margin would not work.
To not forget about chrome extensions blocking google font imports on my browser as I test stuff...
